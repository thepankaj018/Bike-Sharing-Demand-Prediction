# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction

The goal of this machine learning project is to predict the number of rented bikes in a given area, using the provided dataset. The dataset includes the following features:

1.Date in the format of "year-month-day"

2.Rented bike count, which is the count of bikes rented at each hour

3.Hour of the day

4.Temperature in Celsius

5.Humidity in percentage

6.Windspeed in m/s

7.Visibility in 10m

8.Dew point temperature in Celsius

9.Solar radiation in MJ/m2

10.Rainfall in mm

11.Snowfall in cm

12.Seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn)

13.Holiday (Holiday or No holiday)

14.Functional Day (NoFunc - Non Functional Hours, Fun - Functional hours)

To begin, we will start by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to gain a better understanding of the data and identify any patterns or relationships between the features. This will help in identifying the most important features and the correlation between them. We will use visualization techniques to better understand how different features affect the target variable.

After EDA, we will proceed with data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering. The data will be cleaned of missing or duplicate values and any outliers will be handled. We will also create new features based on existing ones that could improve model performance.

Next, we will train different machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees,Gradient Boosting etc. and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as R-squared, MAE, MSE, etc. We will then compare the performance of the different models and select the best one.

Finally, we will use the selected model to make predictions on new unseen data and evaluate the model's performance. The model will be deployed and it can be used for future predictions.

This project can be further improved by adding more data, experimenting with different algorithms, and implementing ensembling techniques to achieve better performance. Additionally, we can also use more advanced techniques like Deep Learning to improve the performance.

In conclusion, this machine learning project aims to predict the number of rented bikes in a given area using a dataset that includes information about date and time, weather conditions, and holiday information. The project will be implemented using Python's popular machine learning libraries, and the best-performing model will be deployed for future predictions.
